            "response": "The opportunities and risks of large language models in mental health: Global rates of mental health concerns are rising, and there is increasing\nrealization that existing models of mental health care will not adequately\nexpand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs)\nhas come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale\nsolutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already\nbeen applied to mental health related tasks. In this paper, we summarize the\nextant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education,\nassessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive\nimpact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs' application\nto mental health and encourage the adoption of strategies to mitigate these\nrisks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with\nresponsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. It is\nespecially critical to ensure that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental\nhealth, enhance mental health equity, and adhere to ethical standards and that\npeople, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are\ninvolved in all stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these\nefforts will minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the\nlikelihood that LLMs will positively impact mental health globally.\n\nDesigning Technologies for Value-based Mental Healthcare: Centering Clinicians' Perspectives on Outcomes Data Specification, Collection, and Use: Health information technologies are transforming how mental healthcare is\npaid for through value-based care programs, which tie payment to data\nquantifying care outcomes. But, it is unclear what outcomes data these\ntechnologies should store, how to engage users in data collection, and how\noutcomes data can improve care. Given these challenges, we conducted interviews\nwith 30 U.S.-based mental health clinicians to explore the design space of\nhealth information technologies that support outcomes data specification,\ncollection, and use in value-based mental healthcare. Our findings center\nclinicians' perspectives on aligning outcomes data for payment programs and\ncare; opportunities for health technologies and personal devices to improve\ndata collection; and considerations for using outcomes data to hold\nstakeholders including clinicians, health insurers, and social services\nfinancially accountable in value-based mental healthcare. We conclude with\nimplications for future research designing and developing technologies\nsupporting value-based care across stakeholders involved with mental health\nservice delivery.\n\nFinancial technologies (FinTech) for mental health: The potential of objective financial data to better understand the relationships between financial behavior and mental health: In this paper, we present novel research methods for collecting and analyzing\npersonal financial data alongside mental health factors, illustrated through a\nN=1 case study using data from one individual with bipolar disorder. While we\nhave not found statistically significant trends nor our findings are\ngeneralizable beyond this case, our approach provides an insight into the\nchallenges of accessing objective financial data. We outline what data is\ncurrently available, what can be done with it, and what factors to consider\nwhen working with financial data. More specifically, using these methods\nresearchers might be able to identify symptomatic traces of mental ill health\nin personal financial data such as identifying early warning signs and thereby\nenable preemptive care for individuals with serious mental illnesses. Based on\nthis work, we have also explored future directions for developing interventions\nto support financial wellbeing. Furthermore, we have described the technical,\nethical, and equity challenges for financial data-driven assessments and\nintervention methods, as well as provided a broad research agenda to address\nthese challenges. By leveraging objective, personalized financial data in a\nprivacy-preserving and ethical manner help lead to a shift in mental health\ncare.",

            "response": "Beyond the heat: The mental health toll of temperature and humidity in India: Evidence on the heat-mental health nexus remains mixed. I show that this can\nbe partly explained by previous studies focusing solely on temperature while\nneglecting temperature-humidity interactions. Using a measure that considers\nboth indicators (wet bulb temperature), I assess the causal link between\nextreme heat and mental health, and its heterogeneity across socioeconomic\nindicators. I combine self-reported depression and anxiety levels from three\nIndian WHO-SAGE survey waves with climate data, leveraging quasi-random\nvariation in heat exposure due to survey timing and location. The results\nreveal that extreme heat increases the risk of depression but not of anxiety.\nImportantly, these effects are consistently smaller when humidity is not\nconsidered. Finally, the study provides evidence that the District Mental\nHealth Program plays a protective role in mitigating adverse mental health\neffects. The findings suggest that the costs induced by climate change need to\naccount for the economic consequences of deteriorated mental health.\n\nCross-Cultural Differences in Mental Health Expressions on Social Media: Culture moderates the way individuals perceive and express mental distress.\nCurrent understandings of mental health expressions on social media, however,\nare predominantly derived from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich,\nand Democratic) contexts. To address this gap, we examine mental health posts\non Reddit made by individuals geolocated in India, to identify variations in\nsocial media language specific to the Indian context compared to users from\nWestern nations. Our experiments reveal significant psychosocial variations in\nemotions and temporal orientation. This study demonstrates the potential of\nsocial media platforms for identifying cross-cultural differences in mental\nhealth expressions (e.g. seeking advice in India vs seeking support by Western\nusers). Significant linguistic variations in online mental health-related\nlanguage emphasize the importance of developing precision-targeted\ninterventions that are culturally appropriate.\n\nExploring Socio-Cultural Challenges and Opportunities in Designing Mental Health Chatbots for Adolescents in India: Mental health challenges among Indian adolescents are shaped by unique\ncultural and systemic barriers, including high social stigma and limited\nprofessional support. Through a mixed-methods study involving a survey of 278\nadolescents and follow-up interviews with 12 participants, we explore how\nadolescents perceive mental health challenges and interact with digital tools.\nQuantitative results highlight low self-stigma but significant social stigma, a\npreference for text over voice interactions, and low utilization of mental\nhealth apps but high smartphone access. Our qualitative findings reveal that\nwhile adolescents value privacy, emotional support, and localized content in\nmental health tools, existing chatbots lack personalization and cultural\nrelevance. These findings inform recommendations for culturally sensitive\nchatbot design that prioritizes anonymity, tailored support, and localized\nresources to better meet the needs of adolescents in India. This work advances\nculturally sensitive chatbot design by centering underrepresented populations,\naddressing critical gaps in accessibility and support for adolescents in India.",

            "response": "A Gamified Framework to Assist Therapists with the ABA Therapy for Autism: We present a framework to assist therapists and children with autism spectrum\ndisorder in their Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy. The framework was\ndesigned in collaboration with Spazio Autismo, an autism center in Mantova,\nItaly. The framework is a first step toward transitioning from the current\npaper-based to fully digital-supported therapy. We evaluated the framework over\nfour months with 18 children diagnosed with classic autism, ranging from 4 to 7\nyears old. The framework integrates a mobile app that children and therapists\nuse during the sessions with a backend for managing therapy workflow and\nmonitoring progress. Our preliminary results show that the framework can\nimprove the efficacy of the therapy sessions, reducing non-therapeutic time,\nincreasing patient focus, and quickening the completion of the assigned\nobjectives. It can also support therapists in preparing learning materials,\ndata acquisition, and reporting. Finally, the framework demonstrated improved\nprivacy and security of patients' data while maintaining reliability.\n\nWhat is \"fundamental\"?: Our collective views regarding the question \"what is fundamental?\" are\ncontinually evolving. These ontological shifts in what we regard as fundamental\nare largely driven by theoretical advances (\"what can we calculate?\"), and\nexperimental advances (\"what can we measure?\"). Rarely (in my view) is\nepistemology the fundamental driver; more commonly epistemology reacts (after a\nfew decades) to what is going on in the theoretical and experimental zeitgeist.\n\nIs nature OO?: What exists \"out there\"? What does \"doing physics\" mean? What are the\naxiomatic ideas for microphysics? What is a particle? What is an apparatus made\nof? We show that Quantum Mechanics textbooks cannot truly answer this kind of\nquestion whereas they should. By adopting a pure \"hitological\" point of view\nfor microphysics, we introduce the Hit in Apparatuses Theory (HAT) and the\nVacuum of Apparatuses (VA) that restore, through Object Orientation (OO), an\nintuitive ontology to deal with this kind of physics. Through a review of what\nit means to \"observe\" and what relativism means in Special and General\nRelativities (SR and GR), we address the problem of finding common maths for GR\nand QM. Finally, with our new HAT, we address the measurement problem in QM and\npropose two possible approaches.",

However, most VR interventions for anxiety have been therapist\nguided rather than self-guided. This systematic review aimed to examine the\neffectiveness and user experience (i.e., usability, acceptability, safety, and\nattrition rates) of self-guided VR therapy interventions in people with any\nanxiety condition as well as provide future research directions. Peer-reviewed\njournal articles reporting on self-guided VR interventions for anxiety were\nsought from the Cochrane Library, IEEE Explore Digital Library, PsycINFO,\nPubMED, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Study data from the eligible\narticles were extracted, tabulated, and addressed with a narrative synthesis. A\ntotal of 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed that\nself-guided VR interventions for anxiety can provide an effective treatment of\nsocial anxiety disorder, public speaking anxiety, and specific phobias. User\nexperiences outcomes of safety, usability, and acceptability were generally\npositive and the average attrition rate was low. However, there was a lack of\nstandardised assessments to measure user experiences. Self-guided VR for\nanxiety can provide an engaging approach for effectively and safely treating\ncommon anxiety conditions. Nevertheless, more experimental studies are required\nto examine their use in underrepresented anxiety populations, their long-term\ntreatment effects beyond 12 months, and compare their effectiveness against\nother self-help interventions for anxiety (e.g., internet interventions and\nbibliotherapy).",

The purpose of this\nstudy is to derive the various internal and external factors that contribute to\nthe anxieties of robo-taxi passengers, and to propose a human-machine interface\n(HMI) concept to resolve such factors, by testing robo-taxi services on real,\ncomplex urban roads. In addition, a remote system for safely testing a\nrobo-taxi in complex downtown areas was constructed, by adopting the Wizard of\nOz (WOZ) methodology. From the results of our tests - conducted upon 28\nsubjects in the central area of Seoul - 19 major anxiety factors arising from\nautonomous driving were identified, and seven HMI functions to resolve such\nfactors were designed. The functions were evaluated and their anxiety reduction\neffects verified. In addition, the various design insights required to increase\nthe reliability of robo-taxis were provided through quantitative and\nqualitative analysis of the user experience surveys and interviews.",
